# Hi there, I'm Colin 👋🏻
<u>

I am a Sophomore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems and 
Computer Science. This summer, I interned at the Software Engineering 
Institute (SEI) and learned best practices in DevSecOps, Code Quality Testing, and 
Software Development. Previously, I worked as a Sensei at CodeNinjas where I helped 
teach young coders about the exciting world of Computer Science!
